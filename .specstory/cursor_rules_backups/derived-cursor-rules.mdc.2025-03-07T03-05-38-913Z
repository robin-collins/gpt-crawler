## PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project is a web crawler designed to extract information from various websites and generate markdown files.  The crawler uses TypeScript and Node.js.  Version history is tracked using git.


## CODE STYLE
Adhere to standard TypeScript coding conventions.  Maintain consistent indentation (2 spaces).  Use descriptive variable and function names.


## FOLDER ORGANIZATION
- `crawled`: Stores the crawled data, organized by source website.
- `src`: Contains the source code for the crawler.
- `example_html`: Example HTML files for testing.


## TECH STACK
- TypeScript
- Node.js
- Git


## PROJECT-SPECIFIC STANDARDS
- All configuration should be managed through the `scrape-config.ts` file.
- Markdown output should follow a consistent structure.


## WORKFLOW & RELEASE RULES
- Use Git for version control.
- Commit messages should be clear and concise.
- Follow a standard release process (detailed in .releaserc).


## REFERENCE EXAMPLES
- Refer to the `example_html` folder for examples of HTML input.


## PROJECT DOCUMENTATION & CONTEXT SYSTEM
- Documentation is stored in the `.specstory` folder.
- Documentation is timestamped and versioned.  New debugging rules and best practices should be added to this folder.


## DEBUGGING
- When debugging the `removeNodesFromDOM` function, ensure that the `createRemoveNodesFunction` in `@visitPageHelpers.ts` is correctly implemented and imported.  Verify that the import path in `scrape-config.ts` is correct (use `"./src/config"` instead of `"./src/config.js"`). Check that `config.ts` correctly exports `visitPageHelpers` without a `.js` extension.  Console logs within `page.evaluate()` will not appear in the Node.js terminal;  use `console.log` outside of `page.evaluate()` to log information to the terminal.  For debugging within `page.evaluate()`, return structured data from the function and log it after the `page.evaluate()` call.

## FINAL DOs AND DON'Ts
- **DO** use descriptive variable names.
- **DO** commit frequently with clear messages.
- **DO** test thoroughly before releasing.
- **DON'T** hardcode values; use configuration files.
- **DON'T** commit unnecessary files.
- **DO** ensure that console logs for debugging purposes are placed appropriately to be visible in the terminal output.  Avoid relying solely on `console.log` within `page.evaluate()` for terminal output.

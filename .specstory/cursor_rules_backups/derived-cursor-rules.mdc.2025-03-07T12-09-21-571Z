## PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project is a web crawler designed to extract information from various websites and generate markdown files.  The crawler uses TypeScript and Node.js.  Version history is tracked using git.


## CODE STYLE
Adhere to standard TypeScript coding conventions.  Maintain consistent indentation (2 spaces).  Use descriptive variable and function names.


## FOLDER ORGANIZATION
- `crawled`: Stores the crawled data, organized by source website.
- `src`: Contains the source code for the crawler.
- `example_html`: Example HTML files for testing.


## TECH STACK
- TypeScript
- Node.js
- Git


## PROJECT-SPECIFIC STANDARDS
- All configuration should be managed through the `scrape-config.ts` file.
- Markdown output should follow a consistent structure.
- Valid CSS selectors (tag, class, ID, attribute, combined, descendant, pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements) are supported for targeting HTML elements.


## WORKFLOW & RELEASE RULES
- Use Git for version control.
- Commit messages should be clear and concise.
- Follow a standard release process (detailed in .releaserc).


## REFERENCE EXAMPLES
- Refer to the `example_html` folder for examples of HTML input.


## PROJECT DOCUMENTATION & CONTEXT SYSTEM
- Documentation is stored in the `.specstory` folder.
- Documentation is timestamped and versioned.  New debugging rules and best practices should be added to this folder.
- The `onVisitPage` function execution order has been corrected to run before markdown conversion (see 2025-03-07_14-08-execution-order-of-onvisitpage-function.md for details).
- Confirmed selector combinations for article tag validation (see 2025-03-07_22-26-validating-css-selectors-for-article-tag.md for details).


## DEBUGGING
- When debugging the `removeNodesFromDOM` function, ensure that the `createRemoveNodesFunction` in `@visitPageHelpers.ts` is correctly implemented and imported.  Verify that the import path in `scrape-config.ts` is correct (use `"./src/config"` instead of `"./src/config.js"`). Check that `config.ts` correctly exports `visitPageHelpers` without a `.js` extension.  Console logs within `page.evaluate()` will not appear in the Node.js terminal;  use `console.log` outside of `page.evaluate()` to log information to the terminal.  For debugging within `page.evaluate()`, return structured data from the function and log it after the `page.evaluate()` call.
- To debug `createRemoveNodesFunction`, log selectors before the `page.evaluate()` call. Within `page.evaluate()`, return structured data (e.g., an object indicating whether selectors were found and their counts) instead of using `console.log`. Log this structured data after the `page.evaluate()` call. Avoid relying solely on `console.log` within `page.evaluate()` for terminal output.
- The order of operations in `core.ts` must ensure that `removeNodesFromDOM` is executed *before* content is captured for markdown output.  Currently, content capture precedes the execution of the removal function, resulting in unwanted content in the output.  This requires a re-ordering of function calls within `core.ts`.  The `onVisitPage` function should be used to modify the DOM *before* content capture to prevent unwanted elements in the final markdown.  Incorrect placement of `console.log` statements within `page.evaluate()` will result in missing debug output in the terminal.  Return structured data from `page.evaluate()` and log it after the call for effective debugging within that function.  Do not modify imports/exports to include or remove `.js` extensions. The TypeScript compiler handles this.
- The `onVisitPage` function, as defined in `scrape-config.ts`, is now correctly executed *before* the content is captured for markdown conversion in `src/core.ts`.  This ensures DOM modifications are applied before content capture. The `onVisitPage` function call has been moved in `src/core.ts` to precede content capture (see 2025-03-07_14-08-execution-order-of-onvisitpage-function.md for details).
- Address linter error in `scrape-config.ts` related to `onProcessMarkdown` not being defined in the Config type.


## FINAL DOs AND DON'Ts
- **DO** use descriptive variable names.
- **DO** commit frequently with clear messages.
- **DO** test thoroughly before releasing.
- **DON'T** hardcode values; use configuration files.
- **DON'T** commit unnecessary files.
- **DO** ensure that console logs for debugging purposes are placed appropriately to be visible in the terminal output.  Avoid relying solely on `console.log` within `page.evaluate()` for terminal output.
- **DO NOT** modify imports/exports to include or remove `.js` extensions.  The TypeScript compiler handles this.
- **DO** ensure that the `removeNodesFromDOM` function executes before content is captured for markdown output to prevent unwanted elements from appearing in the final markdown.  This necessitates a review and adjustment of the function call order in `core.ts`.  The `onVisitPage` function must be called *before* content is captured for markdown processing.
- **DO** utilize a variety of valid CSS selectors (as confirmed in 2025-03-07_22-26-validating-css-selectors-for-article-tag.md) to efficiently target and extract the necessary HTML elements.

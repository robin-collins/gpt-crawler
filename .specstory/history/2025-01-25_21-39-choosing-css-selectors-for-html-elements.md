when choosing a selector,

what about choosing a

<article>

_**Assistant**_

To select an HTML element like `<article>` using a CSS selector, you can simply use the element's tag name as the selector. This is known as a type selector. Here's how you can do it:

```css
article {
  /* Your styles here */
}
```

This selector will apply styles to all `<article>` elements in your HTML document. If you want to be more specific, you can combine it with class or ID selectors:

- To select an `<article>` with a specific class:

  ```css
  article.some-class {
    /* Styles for articles with class 'some-class' */
  }
  ```

- To select an `<article>` with a specific ID:
  ```css
  article#some-id {
    /* Styles for the article with ID 'some-id' */
  }
  ```

These selectors allow you to target elements based on their type, class, or ID, providing flexibility in styling your HTML content.

a "jq" command line that will just output key names in the json

_**Assistant**_

To output just the key names from a JSON object using `jq`, you can use the `keys` function. Here's a command that will do that:

```bash
jq 'keys' yourfile.json
```

This command will output an array of the keys at the top level of the JSON object in `yourfile.json`. If you want to output keys from nested objects, you can use the `..` operator to recursively search through the JSON structure:

```bash
jq 'paths | select(type == "array") | join(".")' yourfile.json
```

This command will output all the paths to keys in the JSON, which can be useful for deeply nested structures.

# Cleanup Process for Generated Files (2025-02-11 12:43:50)

_**User**_

i would like it to cleanup the generated files in the folders root directory after the backup-crawler-output.ts has finished, only the generated files, the ones using the 'outputFileName': from the config. so the process would be, 

crawl pages -> write outputFiles
backup-crawler-output -> copies to a subfolder of the crawled folder, including config file.
delete outputFiles from project root dir

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you modify the `backup-crawler-output.ts` file to clean up the generated files after backing them up. First, let me analyze the code and then make the necessary changes.

Let me search for relevant code first.

Based on the search results, I can see that the output files are generated with the pattern specified in `config.outputFileName`, and they can have numbered suffixes (e.g., output.json, output-1.json, etc.) when the content is split into multiple files.

Let me modify the `backup-crawler-output.ts` file to add the cleanup functionality:

---

```diff
      );
      console.log(`Config file: ${uniqueConfigPath}`);
+ 
+     // Delete the original output files after successful backup
+     console.log("\nCleaning up output files...");
+     for (const outputFile of outputFiles) {
+       await fs.unlink(outputFile);
+       console.log(`Deleted: ${outputFile}`);
+     }
+     console.log("Cleanup completed.");
+ 
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error during backup:", error);
```

I've modified the `backup-crawler-output.ts` file to add cleanup functionality. Here's what the changes do:

1. After successfully backing up all files to the `crawled` subdirectory, it will:
   - Print a message indicating cleanup is starting
   - Iterate through each output file that was backed up
   - Delete each file using `fs.unlink()`
   - Log each deletion
   - Print a completion message

The process now follows exactly what you requested:
1. Crawl pages -> write outputFiles (handled by the main crawler)
2. backup-crawler-output -> copies files to a subfolder of the crawled folder, including config file
3. Delete outputFiles from project root dir (new functionality)

The cleanup only happens after successful backup, so if there's any error during the backup process, the original files will be preserved. This ensures we don't lose any data if something goes wrong during the backup process.

Would you like me to make any adjustments to this implementation?

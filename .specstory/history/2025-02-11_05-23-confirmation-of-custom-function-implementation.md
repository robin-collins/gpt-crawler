# Confirmation of Custom Function Implementation (2025-02-11 15:53:32)

_**User**_

can you confirm that the Optional: Custom function to execute on each page visit shown in @config.example.ts is fully implemented and supported in the codebase

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me analyze the codebase to check the implementation of the `onVisitPage` custom function.

Yes, the `onVisitPage` custom function is fully implemented and supported. Here's the evidence:

1. In `src/config.ts`, the function is properly typed in the schema:

```typescript:src/config.ts
onVisitPage: z
  .function()
  .args(
    z.object({
      page: Page,
      pushData: z.function().args(z.any()).returns(z.promise(z.void())),
    }),
  )
  .returns(z.promise(z.void()))
  .optional(),
```

2. In `src/core.ts`, the function is called within the crawler's requestHandler:

```typescript:src/core.ts
// Inside PlaywrightCrawler requestHandler
if (config.onVisitPage) {
  await config.onVisitPage({ page, pushData: pushDataWrapper });
}
```

The implementation includes:

1. Type safety through Zod schema validation
2. Proper integration in the crawler's request handling flow
3. Access to both the page object and pushData function as shown in the example
4. Proper wrapping of the pushData function to match expected types

The example in config.example.ts accurately represents how to use this feature:

```typescript:config.example.ts
onVisitPage: async ({ page, pushData }) => {
  // Example: Extract page metadata
  const title = await page.title();
  const description = await page.$eval(
    'meta[name="description"]',
    (el) => el.getAttribute("content") || ""
  );
  await pushData({
    title,
    description,
    url: page.url()
  });
},
```

So yes, this feature is fully implemented and supported in the codebase. Users can define custom page visit handlers that have access to both the Playwright page object and a method to push custom data into the crawler's dataset.

---

_**User**_

then using that feature, please solve the following.
 i have identified an issue with the collected data generated by this app, if the source material has codeblocks that are numbered, it can include the numbers as part of the code, i have provided an example in the markdown doc it created. The source page for that code looked identical to @d2lang-docs-tour.html given we can add custom function to execute on each page visit, could we use that to say remove the line numbering, perhaps even ensure the codeblock is encapsulated in a nice and conformant manner for the crawler to injest and for readability to then correctly escape it with triple back ticks in the markdown formatting. I believe teh custom functions can be part of the config.ts file (thus we can add when required)

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, we can use the `onVisitPage` function to clean up code blocks before they're processed. I'll help you create a solution that removes line numbers and ensures proper code block formatting.

Here's how we can modify the config to handle this:

```typescript:config.ts
// ... existing imports ...
import { Config } from "./src/config";

const config: Config = {
  url: "https://docs.example.com",
  match: "https://docs.example.com/**",
  selector: ".documentation-content",
  maxPagesToCrawl: 50,
  outputFileName: "output.md",
  outputFileFormat: "markdown",

  // Add custom page processing
  onVisitPage: async ({ page, pushData }) => {
    // Clean up code blocks before they're processed
    await page.evaluate(() => {
      // Find all code blocks
      const codeBlocks = document.querySelectorAll('pre');
      
      codeBlocks.forEach(pre => {
        // Remove line numbers
        const lineNumbers = pre.querySelectorAll('[style*="user-select: none"]');
        lineNumbers.forEach(num => num.remove());

        // Get the cleaned code content
        let code = pre.textContent || '';
        
        // Remove any leading/trailing whitespace
        code = code.trim();

        // Create a new clean pre element
        const cleanPre = document.createElement('pre');
        const codeElement = document.createElement('code');
        
        // Try to detect language from class or data attribute
        const langMatch = pre.className.match(/language-(\w+)/) || 
                         pre.getAttribute('data-language');
        if (langMatch) {
          codeElement.className = `language-${langMatch[1]}`;
        }
        
        codeElement.textContent = code;
        cleanPre.appendChild(codeElement);

        // Replace the original pre with cleaned version
        pre.replaceWith(cleanPre);
      });
    });

    // Get the page content after cleanup
    const title = await page.title();
    const content = await page.content();
    
    await pushData({
      title,
      url: page.url(),
      content,
    });
  }
};

export default config;
```

This solution:

1. Uses the `onVisitPage` hook to process the page before content extraction
2. Finds all code blocks in the page
3. Removes line numbers by targeting elements with `user-select: none` style (which is commonly used for line numbers)
4. Cleans up the code content and wraps it in proper `<pre><code>` tags
5. Preserves language information if available
6. Replaces the original messy code block with a clean version

Then in `src/core.ts`, the markdown conversion will handle these cleaned code blocks properly since they're now in a standard format.

You can test this by adding a more specific version for the D2 docs:

```typescript:config.ts
const config: Config = {
  url: "https://d2lang.com/tour",
  match: "https://d2lang.com/**",
  selector: ".theme-doc-markdown",
  maxPagesToCrawl: 50,
  outputFileName: "d2-docs.md",
  outputFileFormat: "markdown",

  onVisitPage: async ({ page, pushData }) => {
    await page.evaluate(() => {
      // Target D2 docs specific code blocks
      const codeBlocks = document.querySelectorAll('.CodeBlock pre');
      
      codeBlocks.forEach(pre => {
        // Remove line numbers
        const lineNumbers = pre.querySelectorAll('span[style*="user-select: none"]');
        lineNumbers.forEach(num => num.remove());

        // Clean up the code content
        let code = '';
        const codeSpans = pre.querySelectorAll('span:not([style*="user-select: none"])');
        codeSpans.forEach(span => {
          code += span.textContent;
        });

        // Create clean pre element
        const cleanPre = document.createElement('pre');
        const codeElement = document.createElement('code');
        
        // Try to detect D2 language
        codeElement.className = 'd2';
        codeElement.textContent = code.trim();
        cleanPre.appendChild(codeElement);

        // Replace original pre
        pre.replaceWith(cleanPre);
      });
    });

    const title = await page.title();
    const content = await page.content();
    
    await pushData({
      title,
      url: page.url(),
      content,
    });
  }
};
```

This will ensure that when the content is converted to markdown, the code blocks will be properly formatted without line numbers and with correct language tags. The resulting markdown should have clean code blocks like:

````markdown
```d2
network: {
  cell tower: {
    satellites: {
      shape: stored_data
      style.multiple: true
    }
    // ... rest of code ...
  }
}
```
````

Instead of including the line numbers and other formatting artifacts from the original HTML.

_**User**_

no change in the resultant markdown file i am sorry to say, can you consider and resolve

---

_**Assistant**_

We can resolve the issue by removing the line numbers in a more direct way. In the current implementation we try to remove spans with a certain style—but that sometimes fails because the line numbers are already rendered as text nodes. Instead, we can simply grab the whole text content of the `<pre>` element, then remove any leading numbers (and any extra whitespace) from each line using a regex.

Below is a diff update for your `onVisitPage` function in `config.ts` that does exactly that:

---

**Explanation:**  
This updated code selects all code blocks (using the `.CodeBlock pre` selector), then for each block it:
1. Retrieves the entire text via `pre.innerText`.
2. Splits the text into lines.
3. Removes any leading digits (followed by optional whitespace) from each line.
4. Reassembles the cleaned code and wraps it in a new `<pre><code>` element (assigning a language class if desired).  
This should result in a properly formatted code block in the final markdown, free from line numbers.

With these changes in your `onVisitPage` handler, the code inside the crawled pages will have its line numbers removed. The resulting markdown file (like the sample in `crawled/d2lang/d2-docs.md`) should now contain code blocks formatted with triple backticks and without the unwanted numbering.

Feel free to adjust the regex further if your code blocks use a slightly different pattern for line numbers.

Below is the diff update that fixes the TypeScript errors by casting the code block element to an `HTMLElement` (for accessing `innerText`) and by explicitly typing the parameter for the `map` callback.

---

```diff:config.ts
@@ Within the page.evaluate callback:
-        const originalCode = pre.innerText;
+        const originalCode = (pre as HTMLElement).innerText;
@@
-          .map(line => line.replace(/^\s*\d+\s*/, ''))
+          .map((line: string) => line.replace(/^\s*\d+\s*/, ''))
```

---

**Explanation:**

1. **`innerText` Access:**  
   The error occurs because `pre` is typed as an `Element` which doesn't guarantee an `innerText` property. Casting it to `HTMLElement` (or specifically `HTMLPreElement`) informs TypeScript that `innerText` is available.

2. **Explicit Typing in `map`:**  
   The mapping callback's parameter `line` gets an implicit `any` type. By adding `(line: string)`, we ensure its type is properly known.

Apply these changes to resolve the errors.

_**User**_

absolutely no difference, please consider the source page @intro.html 

---

_**Assistant**_

Below is an updated version of the custom `onVisitPage` hook that now targets all `<pre><code>` elements instead of only those inside a `.CodeBlock` container. It then checks if the code starts with a number and, if so, removes a numeric prefix (with any surrounding whitespace) from each line. This improved method should catch the numbered code blocks (as seen in your markdown output) even when the source page (such as your `intro.html`) does not use a specific container class.

Try applying the following diff update in your `config.ts` file:

---

```diff:title=config.ts
    onVisitPage: async ({ page, pushData }) => {
      await page.evaluate(() => {
-       // Target D2 docs specific code blocks within .CodeBlock pre
-       const codeBlocks = document.querySelectorAll('.CodeBlock pre');
-       codeBlocks.forEach(pre => {
-         // Get the original text including any line numbers
-         const originalCode = (pre as HTMLElement).innerText;
-         // Remove leading line numbers (e.g. "1", "2", etc) from each line
-         const cleanedCode = originalCode
-           .split('\n')

-         cleanPre.appendChild(codeElement);
-
-         // Replace the original pre element with the clean version
-         pre.replaceWith(cleanPre);
-       });
+       // Process all <pre><code> elements in the document
+       const codeElements = document.querySelectorAll('pre code');
+       codeElements.forEach(codeEl => {
+          const originalCode = (codeEl as HTMLElement).innerText;
+          // If the code appears to start with line numbers, clean them
+          if (/^\s*\d+/.test(originalCode)) {
+            const cleanedCode = originalCode
+              .split('\n')
+              .map((line: string) => line.replace(/^\s*\d+\s*/, ''))
+              .join('\n');
+            codeEl.textContent = cleanedCode;
+          }
+       });
```

---

### Explanation

1. **Generic Targeting of Code Blocks:**  
   Instead of only selecting elements inside a `.CodeBlock` container, we now select all `<pre><code>` pairs. This helps in catching code blocks regardless of their containing element.

2. **Conditionally Cleaning Code:**  
   For each code element, the code’s inner text is inspected. If it matches a pattern that starts with a number (using the regex `/^\s*\d+/`), we assume the code block has line numbers. We then split the text into lines and remove any leading digits (and surrounding whitespace) from each line.

3. **Directly Updating the `<code>` Content:**  
   We update the text content of the `<code>` element with the cleaned version. Because this modification is performed in the page context via `page.evaluate()`, it should later be reflected in the HTML returned by `page.content()` and then subsequently processed into markdown by Turndown.

Once you rebuild and run the crawler, the resulting markdown (for example, in `crawled/d2lang/d2-docs.md`) should now have code blocks with line numbers removed. This approach should work even if the original Docusaurus page (such as your `intro.html`) does not wrap code in a specially named container.

If you still see no changes, verify that the code blocks in the source are indeed represented as `<pre><code>` elements and that they include the numbering as text (rather than via CSS counters). You might also add temporary logging inside the evaluated function (using `console.log()`) to check that code elements are found and processed as expected.

_**Assistant**_

Below is the final updated code for your `config.ts` file. With these changes, any `<pre><code>` element whose content begins with line numbers will have those numbers stripped out before extraction. This should solve your issue for the source page similar to `intro.html`.

```typescript:title=config.ts
import { Config } from "./src/config";

export const defaultConfig: Config = {
  url: "https://d2lang.com/tour",
  match: ["https://d2lang.com/tour/**"],
  exclude: [],
  maxPagesToCrawl: 1000,
  topic: "d2lang",
  selector: ".theme-doc-markdown",
  outputFileName: "d2-docs.md",
  outputFileFormat: "markdown",

  // Add custom page processing
  onVisitPage: async ({ page, pushData }) => {
    await page.evaluate(() => {
      // Process all <pre><code> elements in the document
      const codeElements = document.querySelectorAll('pre code');
      codeElements.forEach(codeEl => {
        const originalCode = (codeEl as HTMLElement).innerText;
        // If the code appears to start with line numbers, clean them
        if (/^\s*\d+/.test(originalCode)) {
          const cleanedCode = originalCode
            .split('\n')
            .map((line: string) => line.replace(/^\s*\d+\s*/, ''))
            .join('\n');
          codeEl.textContent = cleanedCode;
        }
      });
    });
    
    // Continue with extraction as usual (if your pushData wrapper requires title and content)
    const title = await page.title();
    const content = await page.content();
    
    await pushData({
      title,
      url: page.url(),
      content,
    });
  }
};
```

### Explanation

- **Generic Code Block Processing:**  
  The function now selects every `<pre><code>` pair on the page regardless of container. This is useful since the Docusaurus source page may not use a dedicated container for code blocks.

- **Line Number Removal:**  
  It verifies if the text starts with digits (`/^\s*\d+/`) and, if so, uses a simple regex replacement on each line to remove those leading numbers along with any extra whitespace.

- **Final Extraction:**  
  After cleaning the code blocks, the crawler retrieves the title and the complete page content and then calls `pushData` so that the downstream conversion to markdown sees these modifications.

Now that you’ve accepted the modifications, simply rebuild and run your crawler. The outputs (such as `crawled/d2lang/d2-docs.md`) should now have clean code blocks without any leading line numbers. 

Let me know if you need any further adjustments!

Below is a version of your `config.ts` file with a drastic custom page processing change that replaces the entire page body with the text:

```
THIS CODE CHANGED THE PAGE PRIOR TO SCRAPING
```

This change should definitely be reflected in your output document.

```typescript:title=config.ts
import { Config } from "./src/config";

export const defaultConfig: Config = {

    await pushData({
      title,
      url: page.url(),
      content,

  }
};
```

After this change, when you run your crawler the output will show the message instead of the original page content. This ensures that the change is definitely applied and you can verify the custom processing works.

_**User**_

the output it created was a bit interesting, yes it did make the modification, but it seems it didnt do it frist, because it output the whole page first, then did the version that got its code changed.

---

_**Assistant**_

Below is one possible solution that avoids double‐pushing output. We do two things:

1. In your configuration (config.ts) we add a new property (for example, `disableDefaultPush`) so that if it’s true our custom `onVisitPage` output will be the only result saved.
2. In your core crawling handler (in src/core.ts) we check for that flag and skip pushing the default article data.

This way, only your custom page processing (which replaces the page content with  
`"THIS CODE CHANGED THE PAGE PRIOR TO SCRAPING"`) is used.

Below are the diffs for both files.

---

**Modify config.ts**

We add the new flag `disableDefaultPush: true` into our default config.

```typescript:config.ts
import { Config } from "./src/config";

export const defaultConfig: Config = {
  url: "https://d2lang.com/tour",
  match: ["https://d2lang.com/tour/**"],
  exclude: [],
  maxPagesToCrawl: 1000,
  topic: "d2lang",
  selector: ".theme-doc-markdown",
  outputFileName: "d2-docs.md",
  outputFileFormat: "markdown",
  disableDefaultPush: true,  // << new flag to disable default output

  // Drastically modify the page before scraping
  onVisitPage: async ({ page, pushData }) => {
    await page.evaluate(() => {
      // Replace the page's content with a constant message
      document.body.innerHTML = "THIS CODE CHANGED THE PAGE PRIOR TO SCRAPING";
    });
    
    // Extract title and content as usual
    const title = await page.title();
    const content = await page.content();
    
    await pushData({
      title,
      url: page.url(),
      content,
    });
  }
};
```

---

**Modify src/core.ts**

Locate the requestHandler in your crawler (e.g., the function in `src/core.ts`) and modify it so that if `disableDefaultPush` is true in the config it skips the default data push. For example, around where the code currently does:

```typescript
    // Save results
    await pushDataWrapper({
      title: article?.title || title,
      url: request.loadedUrl,
      content: article?.content || "",
      textContent: article?.textContent || "",
      excerpt: article?.excerpt || "",
      byline: article?.byline || "",
      siteName: article?.siteName || "",
    });
```

Replace that block with a conditional check:

```diff:src/core.ts
    // Save results - only if disableDefaultPush is not true
-    await pushDataWrapper({
-      title: article?.title || title,
-      url: request.loadedUrl,
-      content: article?.content || "",
-      textContent: article?.textContent || "",
-      excerpt: article?.excerpt || "",
-      byline: article?.byline || "",
-      siteName: article?.siteName || "",
-    });
+    if (!config.disableDefaultPush) {
+      await pushDataWrapper({
+        title: article?.title || title,
+        url: request.loadedUrl,
+        content: article?.content || "",
+        textContent: article?.textContent || "",
+        excerpt: article?.excerpt || "",
+        byline: article?.byline || "",
+        siteName: article?.siteName || "",
+      });
+    }
```

Make sure this check is added **before** the code that calls `if (config.onVisitPage) { ... }` so that only your custom processed output is saved.

### Explanation

- **Config.ts Change:**  
  We set `disableDefaultPush: true` in the configuration. With this flag turned on, our core crawler will no longer push the default extracted page content.

- **Core.ts Change:**  
  In the request handler, we wrap the default call to `pushDataWrapper` in an `if` that checks the new flag. If `disableDefaultPush` is true, then the default push is skipped, and only the data coming from `onVisitPage` (which replaces the page’s content with your intended "THIS CODE CHANGED THE PAGE PRIOR TO SCRAPING" message) is pushed.

Once you rebuild and run your crawler, your final output markdown file (`d2-docs.md`) should now contain only your custom processed page (with the constant message) and not both versions.

Feel free to adjust further if needed!

and why would those changes be needed? what possible could be achieved with the current custom `onVisitPage` config code

---

_**Assistant**_

The idea behind these changes is to allow you to fully control what data is pushed (saved) from each page. Here’s what we achieve with the current custom `onVisitPage` configuration and the associated changes:

1. **Override the Default Extraction:**  
   Normally, the crawler uses Readability (along with other logic) to extract the title, content, text, excerpt, and metadata from a page. This “default push” provides a structured result based on what Readability finds. However, if your pages are in a format that you want to completely modify—such as replacing the content with some constant message—you might not want that default output at all.  
   
   By adding a `disableDefaultPush` flag to your configuration and checking it in your core crawling logic, you stop the default extraction from running. This ensures that only what you output in your custom `onVisitPage` hook is saved.

2. **Drastic Custom Processing:**  
   In our example, the custom `onVisitPage` function replaces the entire content of the page with the string  
   `"THIS CODE CHANGED THE PAGE PRIOR TO SCRAPING"`.  
   
   This might be useful for testing or debugging—with such a drastic change, you can be sure that your custom processing is being applied. In a real-world scenario, you could use a similar approach to filter out unwanted content, fix formatting issues, or sanitize data before it’s stored.

3. **Avoiding Duplicate Outputs:**  
   Without the `disableDefaultPush` flag and corresponding check in the crawler’s default push mechanism, the results from the default extraction (which might include the original content and any artifacts) would be merged with the custom output. In our case, that would mean you might see both the original extracted content and the “changed” content. The flag tells the core crawler, “Only keep what my custom `onVisitPage` produced.”

**What could you achieve with this approach?**

- **Full Sanitization:** You can completely rewrite or sanitize the page content (for example, removing script tags, advertisements, or extraneous navigation elements) before the page is saved.
- **Custom Formatting:** You might want to reformat the page’s HTML into a more readable or themed markdown format.
- **Data Extraction and Filtering:** Prior to saving, you can extract only certain parts of the content (e.g., only the code examples or only the main article text) and discard the rest.
- **Testing the Pipeline:** As in the sample change, setting the page content to a predefined constant is a bulletproof way to ensure your custom processing hook is firing correctly. Once verified, you can replace it with a more fine-grained transformation.

In summary, these changes give you complete control over the page content used in your final output. They’re especially useful if the default extraction doesn’t meet your needs or if you’re troubleshooting issues with the crawled and processed content.

can you please explain what is currently possible with the current codebase in the src/ folder using the custom onVisitPage config modifier. what could that currently do / provide in the way of processing. What is it in its current form most likely designed purpose

---

_**Assistant**_

Below is an explanation of what is currently possible in the codebase in the `src/` folder using the custom `onVisitPage` configuration modifier, as well as its likely design purpose.

---

### What the Custom `onVisitPage` Hook Does Today

The codebase in the `src/` folder (primarily within `src/core.ts` and `src/config.ts`) includes a mechanism for the user to provide a custom function via the `onVisitPage` property in the configuration. Here’s what this hook allows you to do in its current form:

1. **Access the Playwright Page Object**  
   The hook function receives the Playwright `page` object, which gives you full control over the browser context for that page. You can:
   - Run JavaScript within the page using `page.evaluate()`.
   - Wait for selectors or other conditions.
   - Extract page-specific content using the familiar DOM APIs.
   - Interact further with the page (for instance, clicking buttons, scrolling, etc.), if needed.

2. **Push Custom Data**  
   Along with the `page` object, the hook also gets a reference to a wrapped version of `pushData` (labeled here as `pushDataWrapper` in the code). This lets you pass additional or modified data back to the crawler pipeline. For example, you might:
   - Extract extra metadata (beyond what the default Readability extraction provides).
   - Format or transform content into a cleaner format.
   - Apply selective filtering or cleanup (e.g., removing unwanted parts of the page, converting code blocks, etc.).

3. **Override or Supplement the Default Extraction**  
   In the request handler (in `src/core.ts`), after extracting the page’s content using Readability, the code checks if an `onVisitPage` function is present. If so, it executes that function. Depending on your configuration, you can:
   - Perform additional processing (such as modifying the DOM before the content is returned or extracting additional aspects like custom tags or elements).
   - Completely override the default output since you can modify the page’s content before extraction, as demonstrated in the examples (e.g., setting the `document.body.innerHTML` to a specific string).
   - Skip pushing the default output using a flag (such as `disableDefaultPush`), so that only the data your custom function produces is saved.

### Likely Designed Purpose of the Custom `onVisitPage`

The current design of the custom `onVisitPage` hook is intended to give users maximum flexibility when crawling a website. Here are some common scenarios and purposes:

- **Custom Content Extraction:**  
  Websites often have unique structures or elements that the default Readability extraction might not handle perfectly. The hook lets you write custom extraction logic (e.g., using `page.$eval`) to capture exactly what you need—such as metadata, additional text, or even code snippets in a particular format.

- **DOM Manipulation for Cleanup or Reformatting:**  
  Some pages include unwanted artifacts (such as line numbers in code blocks). By using this hook, you can run JavaScript to modify the DOM (for example, stripping out these numbers or reformatting the content) before the content is processed into markdown or other output formats.

- **Precise Control Over Timing and Conditions:**  
  Since the hook is called per page after navigation and just before data is pushed, you have control over waiting for elements (e.g., via custom delays or selectors), ensuring that asynchronous content is loaded, or even triggering specific interactions that ensure the page is in the right state before extraction.

- **Debugging and Testing:**  
  As shown in our drastic-case example (where the page content is replaced with a constant message), the hook can be used as a testing tool. You can verify that your custom processing is correctly executed for every page, which is particularly useful during development or troubleshooting.

---

### Summary

With the current codebase, the custom `onVisitPage` hook allows you to:
- **Directly manipulate the page’s content** (by running code in the browser context).
- **Extract and push custom or additional data** using the provided wrapper.
- **Override or supplement the default content extraction logic** provided by the built-in Readability parser.

Its main intended purpose is to provide flexibility to handle the diversity of web page structures and content requirements, letting users tailor the crawling and extraction process to their specific needs.

_**User**_

all of the things you talked about in your prior message sound like there should be no modifications necessary to any source files. However I suspect that perhaps readability is 'doing its thing' too early in the process. is that a valid statement? i think that when readability code was introduced to aid in markdown generaation, it has been introduced too early in the extraction pipeline. Please consider the version of `src/core.ts` @core-pre-readability.ts  prior to having readability introduced and compare its code flow, and application of the custom onVisitPage code, and then compare that to how it gets handled now in @core.ts . report on the differences (do not attempt code changes)

---

_**Assistant**_

Below is an explanation comparing the two versions of the crawling pipeline—one from the pre-readability implementation (in `src/core-pre-readability.ts`) and the current implementation in `src/core.ts`—with a focus on when and how the custom `onVisitPage` hook is applied. This analysis does not propose further code changes but explains the differences and their implications.

---

### Overview of the Pre-Readability Version (`src/core-pre-readability.ts`)

1. **Targeted Content Extraction:**  
   - The pre-readability version defines a helper, `getPageHtml(page, selector)`, that runs a `page.evaluate()` on the DOM.  
   - This helper checks if the provided selector should be treated as an XPath or CSS selector and returns the text content (using properties like `textContent` or `innerText`) of the target element.  
   - The idea is to extract a specific “slice” of the page—typically the primary content—to be processed further.

2. **Using Readability for Parsing:**  
   - After obtaining the content via `getPageHtml`, the code creates a JSDOM instance from the extracted HTML.
   - Then it uses Mozilla’s Readability to parse that content into a structured article object (with title, content, textContent, excerpt, etc.).
   - This helps transform raw HTML into a more reader-friendly article format.

3. **Calling Custom `onVisitPage`:**  
   - After the default push of this extracted and parsed data (using a wrapped version of `pushData`), the code calls the configured `onVisitPage` function if it exists.
   - At this point, the default extraction (which uses Readability on the pre-extracted content) has already been completed.
   - Users can provide a custom hook (via the configuration) to further process the page or push additional/alternative data.

---

### Overview of the Current Version (`src/core.ts`)

1. **Extraction of Full Page Content:**  
   - In the current version, instead of using a helper like `getPageHtml`, the crawler uses `page.content()` to retrieve the full HTML of the page.
   - This means that instead of focusing on a specific element determined by a selector, you’re getting the entire page (including headers, footers, and sidebars in many cases).

2. **Application of Readability:**  
   - Just as in the pre-readability version, a JSDOM instance is created and Readability is used to parse the HTML.
   - The extraction produces an article with properties such as title, content, etc.

3. **Default Data Push and Custom Hook:**  
   - After creating a wrapper for `pushData` and pushing the default extraction data, the code then calls `if (config.onVisitPage) { ... }` to run the custom hook.
   - This ordering is the same as in the pre-readability version: the default extraction happens before the custom hook is invoked.
   - As a result, any changes you try to make in `onVisitPage` occur after the default extraction has already been processed and saved (unless you disable that default push).

---

### Key Differences and Their Implications

1. **Differences in Content Extraction Method:**  
   - **Pre-Readability Version:** Uses a targeted extraction (via `getPageHtml`) with a given selector—intended to isolate and extract only the main content.
   - **Current Version:** Uses `page.content()`, which returns the entire HTML document.
   - **Implication:** The current version may include more extraneous material compared to what the researcher intended. For example, navigation items or other non-essential elements might be included in the parsed article.

2. **Timing of Custom onVisitPage Execution:**  
   - In **both versions**, the custom `onVisitPage` hook is invoked **after** the default content extraction and push.
   - **Implication:** If your goal is to modify the DOM _before_ the extraction (for example, remove unwanted elements or clean up code blocks), running `onVisitPage` after Readability has been applied means that your modifications will not affect the already extracted article data. In the current design, the custom hook is intended more for appending extra data or processing that runs in parallel to the default behavior—not for preemptively shaping the extraction.

3. **Intended Purpose of the Custom Hook:**  
   - The custom `onVisitPage` hook is designed to give users the flexibility to:
     - **Augment or override data:** You can add extra fields or even replace the extraction entirely if you disable the default push.
     - **Perform additional DOM manipulations:** For instance, you could adjust formatting, remove unwanted elements, or extract custom metrics.
   - However, since it’s executed after the default extraction (using methods like Readability), it is not used to directly modify the extraction process itself unless you intentionally disable the default behavior.

4. **Potential Timing Issues with Readability:**  
   - If you intend to alter the page’s HTML before Readability parses it (for example, modifying code blocks to remove numbering), placing that logic in the custom hook won’t affect the default extraction since Readability has already been applied.
   - A user might suspect that Readability “is doing its thing too early” because the custom modifications in `onVisitPage` do not alter the content seen in the default extraction.

---

### Summary of the Likely Designed Purpose

- **Designed Purpose of the Custom Hook:**  
  The custom `onVisitPage` is intended to allow additional or custom processing of the page after the main extraction has occurred. It is meant to serve scenarios where the default extraction isn’t sufficient on its own (for example, if you want to push extra metadata, sanitize the output, or then override the default push if desired).

- **Current Limitations for Pre-Extraction Modifications:**  
  Because Readability (or the equivalent extraction) is applied before the custom hook is executed, if you need to affect how the content is parsed (for instance, cleaning up code blocks before extraction), the current pipeline does not support that directly through `onVisitPage`. You would have to disable the default extraction and handle the entire process within the custom hook.

In short, the current setup is most likely designed to let you either augment the extracted content or fully override it (by disabling default push and implementing custom logic in onVisitPage) but **not** to intervene in the extraction process itself before Readability is applied. This explains why modifications in `onVisitPage` sometimes appear to have a “late” effect—you’re not modifying the initial extraction but merely appending or supplementing the final data.

# Resolving TypeScript Compile Error in server.ts (2025-03-07 12:43:11)

_**User**_

can you resolve the tsc compile error in server.ts

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you resolve the TypeScript compilation error in server.ts. The error is related to how the swagger-ui-express middleware is being used.

Let me first check the swagger-ui-express package to understand the correct usage pattern.

---

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "import.*swagger-ui-express" ‚Ä¢ **2** files</summary>
        
| File | Line | Match |
|------|------|-------|
| `file:///d%3A/projects/gpt-crawler/src/server.ts` | L5 | `import swaggerUi from "swagger-ui-express";` |
| `file:///d%3A/projects/gpt-crawler/src/server.ts` | L5 | `import swaggerUi from "swagger-ui-express";` |

</details>

---

Now let me check the package.json to see the version of swagger-ui-express being used:

---

Read file: package.json

---

Now let me look at the swagger-ui-express usage in server.ts:

---

Read file: src/server.ts

---

The issue is with the way swagger-ui-express is being used. The TypeScript error suggests there's a type mismatch in how the middleware is being passed to `app.use()`. Let me fix this issue:

---

```diff
  app.use(cors());
  app.use(express.json());
- app.use("/api-docs", swaggerUi.serve, swaggerUi.setup(swaggerDocument));
+ app.use("/api-docs", swaggerUi.serve as any, swaggerUi.setup(swaggerDocument));
  
  // Define a POST route to accept config and run the crawler
```

---

Let's run TypeScript to verify that the error is fixed:

---

```bash
yarn tsc
```

```
yarn run v1.22.22

It looks like we still have an issue. Let's try a different approach. We need to fix both the `serve` and `setup` parts:

---

```diff
  app.use(cors());
  app.use(express.json());
- app.use("/api-docs", swaggerUi.serve as any, swaggerUi.setup(swaggerDocument));
+ app.use("/api-docs", swaggerUi.serve as any[], swaggerUi.setup(swaggerDocument) as any);
  
  // Define a POST route to accept config and run the crawler
```

---

Let's run TypeScript again to check if the error is fixed:

---

```bash
yarn tsc
```

Great! The TypeScript compilation error has been resolved. Let me explain what was happening and how we fixed it:

### The Issue

The error was related to type incompatibility with the swagger-ui-express middleware. The specific error was:

```
No overload matches this call.
Argument of type 'RequestHandler<ParamsDictionary, any, any, ParsedQs, Record<string, any>>[]' is not assignable to parameter of type 'RequestHandlerParams<ParamsDictionary, any, any, ParsedQs, Record<string, any>>'
```

This happens because of type mismatches between the Express types and the swagger-ui-express types. The `swaggerUi.serve` is an array of middleware functions, and `swaggerUi.setup()` returns a middleware function, but the TypeScript types weren't aligning correctly.

### The Solution

We fixed the issue by using TypeScript's type assertion (`as any[]` and `as any`) to tell the TypeScript compiler to trust us that these values are compatible with what Express expects:

```typescript
app.use("/api-docs", swaggerUi.serve as any[], swaggerUi.setup(swaggerDocument) as any);
```

This approach:
1. Casts `swaggerUi.serve` to `any[]` (since it's an array of middleware functions)
2. Casts `swaggerUi.setup(swaggerDocument)` to `any` (since it's a middleware function)

These type assertions tell TypeScript to bypass its type checking for these specific values, allowing the code to compile successfully.

### Alternative Solutions

If you prefer a more type-safe approach, you could:

1. Update the types for swagger-ui-express
2. Use a different pattern for registering the middleware
3. Create a wrapper function that has the correct type signatures

However, the solution we implemented is simple and effective for resolving the immediate compilation error.

# Fixing TypeScript Error: innerText Issue (2025-04-03 13:09:49)

It looks like you have a TypeScript error in `src/core.ts` on line 33. The error `Property 'innerText' does not exist on type 'Element'` occurs because `document.querySelector` returns a generic `Element`, which might not have the `innerText` property. Only `HTMLElement` is guaranteed to have it.

I will cast the result of `document.querySelector(selector)` to `HTMLElement` to fix this type error.

go for it

Okay, I'll make that change. I need to read the relevant section of the file first.

---

Read file: src/core.ts

---

Okay, I will cast the result of `document.querySelector(selector)` to `HTMLElement` in `src/core.ts` to resolve the type error.

---

```diff
      } else {
        // Handle as a CSS selector
-       const el = document.querySelector(selector);
+       const el = document.querySelector(selector) as HTMLElement | null;
        return el?.innerText || "";
      }
```

---

The type error in `src/core.ts` should now be resolved.

can you identify why, when its creating a markdown file, its creating syntax like

```markdown
[

###### First create a store

](#first-create-a-store)
```

I am referring to the new lines that break the markdown link. it should be

```markdown
[###### First create a store](#first-create-a-store)
```

Okay, let's analyze how that broken markdown link syntax might be generated.

Looking at the `src/core.ts` file, specifically the `convertToMarkdown` function:

1.  It uses the `turndown` library to convert HTML (`data.content`) into markdown.
2.  It has a custom rule for converting `<a>` tags (`turndownService.addRule("links", ...)`).
3.  This rule takes the `content` generated by `turndown` for the _inside_ of the `<a>` tag.
4.  It then directly uses this `content` to create the link text: `[${content}](#${localSlug})` or `[${content}](${href})`.

The problem likely occurs if the original HTML inside an `<a>` tag contains block-level elements (like headings `<h1>`-`<h6>`, paragraphs `<p>`, line breaks `<br>`, etc.). When `turndown` converts this, the resulting `content` string might include the markdown equivalents of those elements, including heading markers (`######`) and newlines (`\n`).

The custom `links` rule doesn't currently clean up this `content` before putting it inside the `[]`. So, if `content` is something like `"###### First create a store\n\n"`, the rule creates the broken link: `[###### First create a store\n\n](#first-create-a-store)`.

To fix this, I need to modify the custom `links` rule in `src/core.ts` to clean up the `content` _before_ using it as the link text. This involves removing any leading markdown formatting (like `#`) and collapsing whitespace/newlines into a single space.

I'll read the relevant part of `src/core.ts` and then apply the fix.

Read file: src/core.ts

```diff
        const element = node as HTMLElement;
        const href = element.getAttribute("href");
+
+       // Clean the content for use as link text: remove leading markdown and collapse whitespace
+       const linkText = content.replace(/^#+\s*/, '').replace(/\s+/g, ' ').trim();
+
        if (href && allUrls.includes(href)) {
+         // Use the original, uncleaned content for slugification
          const localSlug = slugify(content);
          return includeExtras
-           ? `[${content}](#${localSlug})`
-           : `[${content}](${href})`;
+           ? `[${linkText}](#${localSlug})`
+           : `[${linkText}](${href})`;
        }
-       return `[${content}](${href})`;
+       return `[${linkText}](${href})`;
      },
    });
```

I've modified the custom rule for handling links (`<a>` tags) in `src/core.ts`.

Here's what I did:

1.  Introduced a `linkText` variable.
2.  Cleaned the original `content` by:
    - Removing any leading `#` characters followed by optional spaces (`/^#+\\s*/`).
    - Collapsing multiple whitespace characters (including newlines) into a single space (`/\\s+/g`).
    - Trimming leading/trailing whitespace (`trim()`).
3.  Used this cleaned `linkText` inside the `[]` of the markdown link.
4.  **Important:** I kept using the original, uncleaned `content` for the `slugify` function to ensure the generated anchor links (`#...`) remain consistent with how headers are likely slugified elsewhere.

This should prevent the broken markdown syntax you observed by ensuring the link text is a single, clean line.

When creating the markdown file, it appears to be repeating / duplicating a part of the header. I have provided examples that are part of the markdown output file `zustand.md`. The html its scraping looks like @zustand.html

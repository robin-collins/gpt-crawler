# Dynamic Language Support for Code Blocks (2025-04-17 09:16:37)

_**User**_

can you modify the addLanguageToCodeBlocks helper script so that it can also be provided with the the language to 'add', currently i think it is fixed to "`text", right now i want to have it "`typescript", but that may change next time.

---

_**Assistant**_

---

Okay, I can modify the `addLanguageToCodeBlocks` function to accept a language parameter.

I will update the function signature to include an optional `language` parameter which will default to `"text"` if not provided. Then I'll modify the `replace` call to use this parameter.

---

````diff
   * @returns The processed markdown with language identifiers added to code blocks
   */
- export function addLanguageToCodeBlocks(markdown: string): string {
+ export function addLanguageToCodeBlocks(
+   markdown: string,
+   language = "text"
+ ): string {
    // Replace code blocks that don't have a language specified
-   return markdown.replace(/```\n/g, "```text\n");
+   const regex = /```(?!\w)/g; // Matches ``` not followed by a word character
+   return markdown.replace(regex, `\`\`\`${language}`);
  }

````

I have modified the `addLanguageToCodeBlocks` function in `src/markdownHelpers.ts`. It now accepts an optional `language` argument, defaulting to `"text"`.

Here's how you can use it:

- `addLanguageToCodeBlocks(markdown)` will add ````text`
- `addLanguageToCodeBlocks(markdown, "typescript")` will add ````typescript`
- `addLanguageToCodeBlocks(markdown, "javascript")` will add ````javascript`

Let me know if you need anything else!

can you evaluate your update against how it gets used in @scrape-config.ts given we now have

_**Assistant**_

You are right. The change I made to `addLanguageToCodeBlocks` introduced an optional parameter, which makes its signature incompatible with the type expected by `onProcessMarkdown` in the `Config` interface.

The `onProcessMarkdown` property expects a function signature like `(markdown: string) => string` or more generally `(markdown: string, ...args: unknown[]) => string`. My change made the signature `(markdown: string, language?: string) => string`.

To fix this, I will wrap the call to `markdown.addLanguageToCodeBlocks` in `scrape-config.ts` with an anonymous function that matches the expected signature and passes the desired language ("typescript") explicitly.

I'll first read the `Config` type definition to be sure.

---

Read file: src/config.ts

---

Okay, the `configSchema` confirms that `onProcessMarkdown` expects a function that takes exactly one string argument and returns a string:

```typescript
  onProcessMarkdown: z
    .function()
    .args(z.string()) // Expects a single string argument
    .returns(z.string())
    .optional(),
```

I will now modify `scrape-config.ts` to wrap the `addLanguageToCodeBlocks` call.

---

```diff
    outputFileFormat: "markdown",
    // onVisitPage: combinedOnVisitPage,
-   onProcessMarkdown: markdown.addLanguageToCodeBlocks,
+   onProcessMarkdown: (markdown) =>
+     markdown.addLanguageToCodeBlocks(markdown, "typescript"),
  };

```

---

It seems I made a mistake in the edit. I used `markdown.addLanguageToCodeBlocks` inside the anonymous function, but `markdown` there refers to the string argument of the anonymous function, not the imported module alias.

I'll correct this by using the correct module alias `ConfigModule.markdown`.

---

```diff
    outputFileFormat: "markdown",
    // onVisitPage: combinedOnVisitPage,
-   onProcessMarkdown: (markdown) =>
-     markdown.addLanguageToCodeBlocks(markdown, "typescript"),
+   onProcessMarkdown: (md) =>
+     ConfigModule.markdown.addLanguageToCodeBlocks(md, "typescript"),
  };

```

---

That should fix the TypeScript error. I've corrected the reference inside the anonymous function to use `ConfigModule.markdown.addLanguageToCodeBlocks` and passed "typescript" as the desired language.

---

_**User**_

one issue with the implementation, it is now outputting markdown with codeblocks encapsulated like lines 35-37 in @reactflow.md . We only want langauge specifier on the starting triple back tick, not sure how you will handle that one.

---

_**Assistant**_

---

You've spotted the issue correctly. My previous regex `/```(?!\w)/g` was too broad and matched any triple backticks not followed by a word character, including the closing ones.

To fix this, I'll change the regex to specifically target triple backticks that appear at the beginning of a line and are immediately followed by a newline. This is a much stronger indicator of an opening code block fence that is missing a language identifier.

I will modify the `addLanguageToCodeBlocks` function in `src/markdownHelpers.ts` again.

---

````diff
  ): string {
    // Replace code blocks that don't have a language specified
-   const regex = /```(?!\w)/g; // Matches ``` not followed by a word character
-   return markdown.replace(regex, `\`\`\`${language}`);
+   // Only target ``` at the beginning of a line followed by a newline
+   const regex = /^```\n/gm;
+   return markdown.replace(regex, `\`\`\`${language}\n`);
  }

````

---

I've updated the regex in `src/markdownHelpers.ts`. Now, it should only add the language identifier to the opening `fence when it appears at the start of a line and doesn't already have a language specified. This should prevent the issue of adding the language to the closing` fence.

---

_**User**_

uhm, dont both opening and closing backticks appear at the start of a line

---

_**Assistant**_

You are absolutely right! My apologies, that was a significant oversight in my previous regex logic. Both opening and closing fences can indeed start at the beginning of a line.

The regex `/^```\\n/gm` was flawed because it didn't correctly interpret the multiline flag (`m`) and the newline character (`\n`) in the way needed.

Let's try a more robust regex that specifically targets lines starting with ```, ensures there isn't already a language identifier immediately after it, matches any potential whitespace on the rest of the line, and ends with a newline. This should correctly identify untagged opening fences while ignoring tagged ones and, hopefully, most closing fences (assuming they are typically just ```` on a line).

Regex: `/^```(?!\w)([^\S\n\r]*)\n/gm`
Replacement: ` ```${language}$1\n`

Let me break down this new regex:

1.  `^```: Matches ```` at the absolute start of a line (due to the `m` flag).
2.  `(?!\w)`: This is a negative lookahead. It asserts that the character immediately following `is *not* a word character (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, \_). This prevents matching fences that already have a language like`javascript`.
3.  `([^\S\n\r]*)`: This captures any whitespace characters (spaces, tabs - but not newlines) that might exist between ````and the end of the line. We capture this (Group 1) to preserve it in the replacement.`\S`is non-whitespace, so`[^\S\n\r]` matches only whitespace other than newlines.
4.  `\n`: Matches the newline character that terminates the line.

The replacement ` ```${language}$1\n` inserts the language, re-inserts any captured whitespace (`$1`), and adds the newline back.

I will apply this corrected regex to the `addLanguageToCodeBlocks` function.

---

````diff
  ): string {
    // Replace code blocks that don't have a language specified
-   // Only target ``` at the beginning of a line followed by a newline
-   const regex = /^```\n/gm;
-   return markdown.replace(regex, `\`\`\`${language}\n`);
+   // Only target ``` at the beginning of a line, not followed by a word character,
+   // potentially followed by whitespace, and ending with a newline.
+   const regex = /^```(?!\w)([^\S\n\r]*)\n/gm;
+   return markdown.replace(regex, `\`\`\`${language}$1\n`);
  }

````

---

Okay, I've updated the function `addLanguageToCodeBlocks` in `src/markdownHelpers.ts` with the refined regex.

This version should now correctly:

- Add the specified language to lines like ` ```\n` or ` ``` \n`.
- Ignore lines that already have a language, like ` ```javascript\n`.
- Ignore most closing fences, assuming they are typically just ```` on a line by themselves.

**Limitation:** This regex _might_ still incorrectly add a language identifier to a _closing_ fence if that closing fence happens to be formatted exactly like an untagged opening fence (e.g., ` ```\n`). A truly perfect solution would require more complex parsing beyond a single regex replacement, but this approach should handle the vast majority of standard Markdown cases correctly.

"A truly perfect solution would require more complex parsing beyond a single regex replacement", then do so

---

_**Assistant**_

You're right, let's implement a more robust parsing solution. Instead of relying solely on regex replacement, I'll parse the markdown line by line, keeping track of whether we are currently inside a code block. This allows us to definitively identify opening fences and only add the language identifier when necessary.

Here's the plan:

1.  Split the markdown string into an array of lines.
2.  Iterate through the lines, maintaining a boolean flag `inCodeBlock`.
3.  When a line starts with ````:
    - If `inCodeBlock` is `false`, treat it as an opening fence. Check if it already has a language identifier (e.g., ` ```javascript`). If not, insert the specified `language`. Set `inCodeBlock` to `true`.
    - If `inCodeBlock` is `true`, treat it as a closing fence and leave it unchanged. Set `inCodeBlock` to `false`.
4.  Append the (potentially modified) line to a result array.
5.  Join the result array back into a string.

I will now rewrite the `addLanguageToCodeBlocks` function in `src/markdownHelpers.ts` with this logic.

````diff
    language = "text"
  ): string {
-   // Replace code blocks that don't have a language specified
-   // Only target ``` at the beginning of a line, not followed by a word character,
-   // potentially followed by whitespace, and ending with a newline.
-   const regex = /^```(?!\w)([^\S\n\r]*)\n/gm;
-   return markdown.replace(regex, `\`\`\`${language}$1\n`);
+   const lines = markdown.split('\n');
+   const processedLines: string[] = [];
+   let inCodeBlock = false;
+   const fenceRegex = /^\s*```(.*)/; // Matches ``` and captures anything after
+
+   for (const line of lines) {
+     const match = line.match(fenceRegex);
+
+     if (match) {
+       if (!inCodeBlock) {
+         // Entering a code block
+         const existingLang = match[1].trim();
+         if (!existingLang) {
+           // No language specified, add the default/provided one
+           processedLines.push(`\`\`\`${language}`);
+         } else {
+           // Language already exists, keep the line as is
+           processedLines.push(line);
+         }
+         inCodeBlock = true;
+       } else {
+         // Exiting a code block, keep the closing fence as is
+         processedLines.push(line);
+         inCodeBlock = false;
+       }
+     } else {
+       // Not a fence line, add it as is (respecting if inside a code block or not)
+       processedLines.push(line);
+     }
+   }
+
+   return processedLines.join('\n');
  }

I have updated the `addLanguageToCodeBlocks` function in `src/markdownHelpers.ts` with the line-by-line parsing logic. This approach is more robust and should correctly handle adding the specified language only to opening code block fences that don't already have one, while leaving closing fences and fences with existing languages untouched.

in markdown, can i specify image size?

---

_**Assistant**_

---

Standard Markdown syntax itself, like `![alt text](image_url.jpg)`, does **not** have a built-in way to specify image dimensions (width or height).

However, since most Markdown parsers allow embedding raw HTML, the common and most widely supported way to control image size within a Markdown file is to use the standard HTML `<img>` tag:

```html
<img src="image_url.jpg" alt="alt text" width="300" height="200" />
```

Or using the `style` attribute for more control (like percentages):

```html
<img src="image_url.jpg" alt="alt text" style="width: 50%; height: auto;" />
```

**In summary:**

- **Standard Markdown:** No native syntax for image size.
- **Common Workaround:** Use HTML `<img>` tags with `width`, `height`, or `style` attributes directly in your Markdown file.

Some specific Markdown platforms or processors _might_ introduce non-standard extensions to handle this (e.g., `![alt text](url){width=100}`), but relying on the HTML `<img>` tag is the most portable and reliable method.

### Chore

- Investigated an issue where code blocks from pages similar to `hyperdiv.html` were rendered with single backticks instead of triple backticks. The root cause appears to be a combination of how the `Readability` library parses HTML structures like `div.codehilite` and how `TurndownService` subsequently converts these potentially altered structures to Markdown. No code changes were made during this investigation.

# [1.5.0](https://github.com/BuilderIO/gpt-crawler/compare/v1.4.0...v1.5.0) (YYYY-MM-DD)

### Added

- Added `cleanHyperdivCodeBlocks` function to `src/visitPageHelpers.ts`. This function cleans up `div.codehilite` structures by replacing them with their inner `pre` tag, aiming to improve Markdown conversion consistency for code blocks from Hyperdiv-like documentation sites.

# [1.5.1](https://github.com/BuilderIO/gpt-crawler/compare/v1.5.0...v1.5.1) (YYYY-MM-DD)

### Added

### Changed

- Modified `cleanCodeBlocks` in `src/visitPageHelpers.ts` to attempt to preserve existing language classes from `<code>` or `<pre>` elements, defaulting to `language-text` if none is found. This replaces the previous behavior of hardcoding `language-bash`.

### Fixed

- Modified `cleanCodeBlocks` in `src/visitPageHelpers.ts` to preserve leading and trailing whitespace (including newlines and indentation) by removing `.trim()` calls that were affecting individual lines and the entire code block. This is critical for whitespace-sensitive languages like Python.

# [1.5.3](https://github.com/BuilderIO/gpt-crawler/compare/v1.5.2...v1.5.3) (YYYY-MM-DD)

### Added

### Changed

- Modified `cleanCodeBlocks` in `src/visitPageHelpers.ts` to use `innerText.split('\n')` instead of `textContent.split('\n')` for splitting code into lines. This is an attempt to better preserve newlines in code blocks that are heavily structured with inline `<span>` elements for syntax highlighting, as `innerText` can better reflect visual line breaks.

### Fixed

- Modified `cleanCodeBlocks` in `src/visitPageHelpers.ts` to ensure that empty lines (including those that become empty after prefix removal) are preserved in the output, unless they are specifically the "$ powershell" command line. This fixes an issue where intentional blank lines in code (e.g., in Python) were being removed.
